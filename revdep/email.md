Hi,

This is an automated email to let you know about the release of {{{ my_package }}}, which I'll submit to CRAN on ({{{ date }}}).

To check for potential problems, I ran `R CMD check` on your package {{{your_package}}} ({{{your_version}}}).

I found: {{{your_summary}}}.

{{#you_have_problems}}
{{{your_results}}}

To get the development version of {{{ my_package }}} so you can run the checks yourself, you can run:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("{{my_github}}")

To see what's changed visit <https://github.com/{{{my_github}}}/blob/master/NEWS.md>.

{{/you_have_problems}}
{{^you_have_problems}}
It looks like everything is ok, so you don't need to take any action, but you might want to read the NEWS, <https://github.com/{{{my_github}}}/blob/master/NEWS.md>, to see what's changed.
{{/you_have_problems}}

If you have any questions about this email, please feel free to respond directly.

Regards,

{{{ me }}}
